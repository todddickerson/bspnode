# BSPNode Development Handoff

## Current Session Summary
**Date**: January 31, 2025
**Last Commit**: b9195a4 - Add device preferences and improve viewer experience

## Active Issues & TODOs

### 1. **Host Invite Creation Error** ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY
- **Issue**: "Failed to create invite" error when clicking Create button
- **Root Cause**: Prisma client needs regeneration after HostInvite model was added
- **Solution**: Server restart required (npm run dev)
- **Status**: Fixed in code, awaiting server restart

### 2. **Real-time Viewer Stats** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Viewer count and heart reactions not updating in real-time
- **Implementation**: Socket.io listeners added in studio page
- **Missing**: Server-side Socket.io handlers in /api/socket need implementation
- **Files**: 
  - `/app/stream/[id]/studio/page.tsx` - Client listeners added
  - `/server.js` - May need Socket.io event handlers

### 3. **Multi-Host Display Layouts** ðŸŸ¢ FEATURE REQUEST
- **Description**: Allow hosts to choose different display layouts for multi-host streams
- **Options**: Grid view, Speaker focus, Picture-in-Picture, etc.
- **Reference**: Use LiveKit's layout options (check with context7 MCP)
- **Status**: TODO - Not started

### 4. **Chat Message Persistence** ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM
- **Issue**: Chat messages are not persisted to database
- **Current**: Messages only exist in memory during stream
- **Need**: Save messages to database and load history when joining
