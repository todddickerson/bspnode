# BSPNode Development Handoff

## Current Session Summary
**Date**: January 31, 2025
**Last Update**: Fixed studio state variables + identified real-time chat issues

## Critical Issues Needing Immediate Attention

### 1. **Real-time Chat Not Working** ðŸ”´ CRITICAL
- **Problem**: Chat messages don't update in real-time for studio or viewer modes
- **Symptoms**: Messages only appear after page refresh
- **Root Cause**: Likely Supabase real-time subscription issues
- **Files Affected**:
  - `/lib/supabase-hooks.ts` - Chat subscription logic
  - `/components/studio-chat-supabase.tsx` - Studio chat UI
  - `/components/chat-supabase.tsx` - Viewer chat UI
- **Debug Steps Needed**:
  1. Verify Supabase environment variables in `.env.local`
  2. Check Supabase dashboard for real-time permissions/RLS policies
  3. Add console logging to subscription events
  4. Test manual database inserts via Supabase dashboard

### 2. **Video Feed Quality Issues** ðŸŸ¡ INVESTIGATION NEEDED
- **Problem**: Camera feed sometimes shows "For video API test purposes only"
- **Location**: Studio page video element
- **Potential Causes**:
  - LiveKit track not publishing correctly
  - Egress not capturing right video source
  - Device switching affecting video feed
- **Next Steps**: Add debugging to track publishing state

### 3. **Multi-Host Display Layouts** ðŸŸ¢ FEATURE REQUEST
- **Description**: Allow hosts to choose different display layouts for multi-host streams
- **Options**: Grid view, Speaker focus, Picture-in-Picture, etc.
- **Reference**: Use LiveKit's layout options (check with context7 MCP)
- **Status**: TODO - Not started
