# Pricing Comparison: Mux vs Agora

## Summary
For broadcasting to many viewers with few hosts, Mux is 5-10x cheaper than Agora.

## Example: 1-Hour Stream
### 2 hosts → 500 viewers
- **Mux**: ~$26 total
- **Agora**: ~$60 total

### 2 hosts → 5,000 viewers  
- **Mux**: ~$265
- **Agora**: ~$600

## Why Mux is Cheaper
1. **Mux**: Pay once to encode, minimal delivery costs
2. **Agora**: Pay per participant minute (including viewers)

## Hybrid Approach (Best Value)
- Use Agora for host-to-host collaboration (~$1/hour)
- Use Mux for broadcasting to viewers (~$25/hour for 500 viewers)
- Total savings: 80% less than pure Agora

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with Mux only (simplest, cheapest)
2. Add Agora later if real-time host collaboration needed
3. Bridge systems with RTMP for hybrid approach
